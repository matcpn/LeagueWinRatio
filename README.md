LeagueWinRatio
==============

Put in a summoner's name in league, press the execute button.

First time doing asynchronous programming. Just kinda messing around. The code isn't great, but it's mostly funcional

Also wanted to try using an API, and the Riot API was just released and looked easy to use, and I needed to brush up on javascript/JQuery knowledge... Good, fun project
